Having my own Yubikey Neo key, that supports U2F, I've got really interested in FIDO U2F protocol. It's a registration defined, challenge-response public key signature second factor authentication protocol, developed by FIDO Alliance. Key properties of the protocol are: Open, Private, Secure and Phishing proof.

In my research I've studied specs, solutions, case studies, security requirements. I also have contributed to FIDO-DEV community, and to Yubico FIDO U2F libraries, and have post a post about FIDO U2F for Russian tech community [HabraHabr](https://habrahabr.ru/post/305508/). I have implemented [Python Flask](https://github.com/herrjemand/flask-fido-u2f) and [Django](https://github.com/herrjemand/django-fido-u2f) plugins, and created a [demo](https://u2f.jeman.de/).

I have done presentation for Wellington Python meetup, and been accepted as a speaker of KiwiPyCon2016. My research had caught and eye of Yubico who were happy to sponsor me to go to KiwiPyCon. Big thanks to them for sponsoring me.
